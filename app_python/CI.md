# CI Best Practices applied in CI

## Efficient Dependency Management

To expedite the setup process, I created caching for the pip dependencies. This approach 
significantly reduces the time required for dependency installation by reusing previously 
downloaded packages.


## Parallel Testing

I have adopted a matrix strategy in the workflow, enabling simultaneous execution across 
multiple versions of Python. This parallelism allows to identify compatibility issues and 
ensures the application performs consistently across different environments.


## Streamlined Job Execution

The CI pipeline is structured to maintain clear dependencies between jobs. Specifically, 
the Docker-related tasks are configured to commence only after the build process concludes 
successfully, ensuring a logical sequence of operations.

## Environment Isolation

Each job within the CI workflow operates in a separate environment. This isolation guarantees 
that modifications made in one job do not influence the execution of subsequent jobs, 
maintaining the integrity of the testing and deployment processes.

## Secure Credential Handling

Docker Hub and Snyk credentials are securely stored as GitHub secrets and are accessed within 
the workflow using the secret variables. This method safeguards the credentials while enabling 
automated processes.

## Clarity and Structure

The jobs are properly named and organized to clearly convey their purpose and dependencies. 
This clarity enhances the readability of the CI configuration and facilitates easier 
maintenance and updates.

## Vulnerability Scanning

Incorporating Snyk into the CI pipeline allows to proactively scan for and address 
vulnerabilities. This tool plays a crucial role in maintaining the security and robustness of 
the application by identifying potential threats early in the development cycle.
